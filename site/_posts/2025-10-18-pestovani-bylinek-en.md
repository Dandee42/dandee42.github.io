## By way of introduction

Growing herbs at home is not difficult and has many benefits. Fresh herbs can be used in cooking, in teas or as decoration.

## How to get started

1. **Choose the right herbs** - basil, parsley, mint or rosemary are ideal.
2. **Select the right pot** - it should have a drainage hole to prevent waterlogging.
3. **Use a good quality potting medium** - light and airy, ideally with a little sand for drainage.

## Herb Care

- Water regularly but do not overwater.  
- Place them in a sunny spot - most herbs need at least 4-6 hours a day.  
- Prune the leaves regularly to keep the plant growing healthy and thick.

## Extra tips

> "Herbs retain their aroma best if you harvest them just before use."

- Experiment with combinations of different herbs in the kitchen.  
- Some herbs can even be dried for later use.

## Conclusion

Growing herbs at home is a great way to keep fresh ingredients on hand and brighten up your home with greenery.
