## How to start home growing herbs

Growing herbs at home is a great way to have fresh ingredients on hand and make your interior more pleasant at the same time. This article will show you how to get started without needing a garden.

## Choosing herbs

First, choose the herbs you want to grow. Some are suitable for beginners:

- **Basil** - loves sun and regular watering.  
- **Passionflower** - grows quickly and will last in smaller pots.  
- **Mint** - grows almost on its own, but it is recommended to grow it separately as it grows quickly.  

## What you will need

- Pots with drainage holes
- Good quality potting soil for herbs
- A light spot (ideally a south-facing windowsill)
- A small watering can

## Herb care

1. **Watering** - herbs need regular but not excessive water. The soil should be moist, not wet.  
2. **Fertilising** - add herb fertiliser once a month.  
3. **Trimming** - trim the leaves regularly to keep the plants lush and healthy.  

## Benefits of home growing

- Fresh and tasty ingredients on hand
- Reduction in the use of plastic packaging from the store
- A pleasant relaxing hobby

## Conclusion

Getting started with home growing herbs is easy and rewarding. All it takes is a few pots, a little care and soon you'll have fresh herbs for your dishes.
