## Editorial

Working from home often means sitting for long hours, which can negatively affect your health. Small changes to your daily routine can help you stay active.

## Movement tips

1. **Short Stretching Breaks** - Take 2-3 minutes every hour to do simple stretches for your neck, shoulders and back.  
2. **Standing during phone calls** - instead of sitting during calls, you can stand or walk around the room.  
3. **Table exercises** - e.g. leg lifts, table push-ups or squats.  
4. **Walking around the house** - use coffee or water breaks to take a few steps around the apartment.  
5. **Online exercise videos** - short 10-15 minute workouts are a great addition.

## Bonus Tips

> "Small changes make a big difference - even 5 minutes of exercise every hour helps."

- Set reminders to move.  
- Use an ergonomic chair and desk.  
- Track your activity with an app or fitness bracelet.

## Conclusion

Even when working from home, it's possible to stay active and healthy. Just get up regularly, stretch, and find small ways to move throughout the day.
