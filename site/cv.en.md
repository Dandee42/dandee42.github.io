# About me
At the beginning of 2024, I decided to make a major career change and began working intensively on transitioning from an online marketer to the world of IT. As part of this transformation, I completed several training courses focused on **web application development and testing**, particularly using Python.

Gradually, I learned not only how to test manually, but also how to automate tests using **Playwright** and Selenium, create simple applications in the **Django** platform, and later discover the potential of process automation using **n8n**.

## Why IT and automation
In one of my positions as an online marketer, I was fortunate enough to be able to look over the shoulders of programmers developing an e-shop, which opened up a whole new world for me. I enjoyed participating in the development of the e-shop step by step, coming up with new functionalities, testing, and proposing suitable solutions to current problems.

This experience inspired me to switch to IT and laid the foundation for my current career path â€“ **test automation and business workflow automation**.

## Where I am currently headed and what I can offer you
My experience in **e-commerce** and online marketing continues to help me better understand the context of e-shop testing. Currently, I focus primarily on test automation using **Playwright**, but also on process automation using **n8n**, which has impressed me with its capabilities.

My goal is to create solutions that save time, minimize errors, and simplify work for teams and companies.
