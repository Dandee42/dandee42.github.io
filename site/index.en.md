## I'm Daniel, a novice web application developer and automation architect
At the beginning of 2024, I decided to make a major career change and began working intensively on transitioning from an online marketer to the world of IT. As part of this transformation, I completed several training courses focused on **web application development and testing**, particularly using Python.

Gradually, I learned not only how to test manually, but also how to automate tests using **Playwright** and Selenium, create simple applications in the **Django** platform, and later discover the potential of process automation using **n8n**.

## Why did I switch to the IT world?
In one of my positions as an online marketer, I was lucky enough to get a glimpse behind the scenes of programmers developing an e-shop, which opened up a whole new world for me. I enjoyed being involved in the development of the e-shop step by step, coming up with new functionalities, testing, and proposing suitable solutions to current problems. I believe that this experience provided me with a solid foundation for a career change.

## Where I am currently headed and what I can offer you
My experience in **e-commerce** and online marketing continues to help me better understand the context when testing e-shops. Currently, I focus primarily on test automation using **Playwright** and other tools, process automation using **n8n**, which has impressed me with its capabilities, and **web application development**. 

I am now only marginally involved in online marketing and want to leave it completely in the future.
